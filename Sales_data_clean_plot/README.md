# Sales Data Analysis with Python

This project demonstrates how to perform basic data analysis and visualization tasks using Python's pandas and matplotlib libraries. The goal of the project is to analyze sales data and visualize key insights such as:

- Total sales amount over time.
- Distribution of sales amount by product category.
- Distribution of sales amount by gender.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

1. **sales_data.csv**: Sample dataset containing sales records including the date, customer ID, product category, sales amount, and gender.
2. **sales_analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis and visualization.
3. **README.md**: Markdown file providing an overview of the project, instructions for running the code, and any additional information.

## Usage

To run the analysis:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `sales_analysis.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Execute the cells in the notebook to load the data, perform analysis, and generate visualizations.
