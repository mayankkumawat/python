# Simple Stopwatch Program

This Python program implements a simple stopwatch functionality using the `time` module. The program allows the user to start and stop the stopwatch, record lap times, and display the total elapsed time.

## Functionality

- **Start Stopwatch**: Press ENTER to start the stopwatch.
- **Record Lap Time**: Press ENTER again to record a lap time.
- **Display Lap Time**: The program displays the lap number, total elapsed time, and lap time for each lap.
- **Stop Program**: Press Ctrl-C to stop the program and quit.

## Usage

1. Run the program.
2. Press ENTER to start the stopwatch.
3. Press ENTER again to record a lap time.
4. Repeat step 3 to record additional lap times.
5. Press Ctrl-C to stop the program.

## Implementation

The program uses the following steps to implement the stopwatch functionality:

1. Display program instructions.
2. Start tracking lap times.
3. Handle user input to record lap times and calculate total elapsed time.
4. Handle the Ctrl-C exception to gracefully exit the program.

## Dependencies

The program only relies on the Python standard library and does not require any external dependencies.
